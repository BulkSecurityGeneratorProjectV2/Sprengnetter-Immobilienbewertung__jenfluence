# jenfluence
Jenkins (workflow) plugin that is able to publish information on Atlassian Confluence pages.

Currently, the only feature is to create or retrieve a page via the Confluence REST API.

Our future plans are to extend the plugin so that only certain areas on a page can be updated or information can be inserted at specified markers. The deletion of pages and the publishing of other plugin data such as checkstyle, findbugs, javadoc or jacoco mark further milestones.
