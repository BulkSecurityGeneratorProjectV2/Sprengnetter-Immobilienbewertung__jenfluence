<div>
    <p>
        This is the key of the space where the page resides. Usually it is a short form of the title of the space. If
        you have no clue where to find the key you can visit the space in your browser and extract the key from the URL.
    </p>
    <p>It will look like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <em>http://$host/display/<strong>KEY</strong>/.../...</em>
    </ul>

    <p>Copy that key and paste it in here.</p>
